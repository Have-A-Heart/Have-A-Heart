        Imagine being given a chance to re-enter society but there are obstacles in your way making it difficult to re-enter society? That's what happened to Robert when he was released from a 5-year prison sentence and placed on lifetime probation. And no matter what, the good he has done, whether it's for himself or for society, is either used against him or taken away from him.

        On August 25th, 2024, Robert had a minor mental health crisis regarding the difficulties he felt were cruel given by his probation officer, and the fact no one would hire him due to the nature of his criminal record, he voluntarily checked himself into a nearby Mental Health Facility to talk about his problems. When asked to be specific about the things he thinks about, such as homicidal and/or suicidal thoughts, he gave full confidence to the intake specialist; knowing he would be protected by HIPPA Laws. Unfortunately, they reported such “threats” to his probation officer and instead of acknowledging that he did the right thing, his probation officer threatened to arrest him.

        On September 11th, 2024, Robert was required to take a polygraph as a condition of his probation and being Hard of Hearing/Deaf, he asked if there would be a Sign Language interpreter present. His probation officer said he would look into it but never got back to him. Robert attended the polygraph session without a Sign Language interpreter present.

        On September 26th, 2024, Robert confided in his probation officer that he has been attending SAA (Sex Addicts Anonymous–based on the principles of AA) while incarcerated and continued the program after release to help battle the most and deadliest addiction–pornography–that got him arrested in the first place, even though; it is not court ordered. Days later, he was told not to attend anymore because they are not “licensed clinicians”, otherwise he could be arrested.

        On June 2nd, 2025, his probation officer discovered that Robert writes stories as a way to cope with his anger and to fulfill his lifelong dream of becoming a prolific and successful author like Stephen King. Instead of acknowledging that writing is very therapeutic and the fact he had found a passion and purpose in life, he was told that he had to be careful with what he writes because it can be a “violation” of his probation and used against him.

        Despite his strength and resilience to prove that he is serious about turning his life completely around, he feels that it will never happen. He cannot do this alone.

        Without immediate awareness, Robert risks being mistreated by his probation officer and continues to live in fear. Time is critical, and every signature and every donation brings us closer to reform.

        We are aiming to raise $5,000 to start with, to cover legal fees. Every dollar will go directly ensuring Robert gets the support he needs to recover and rebuild his life.

        Despite everything, Robert still writes stories. His courage inspires everyone around him, and we want to ensure they can continue to share their light with the world.

        Having a heart can change a life. Please consider signing the petition, donating, and sharing this campaign with your friends and family. Together, we can give Robert and his family the hope and support they need.
